## React Project for start2impact University

Hello, this is my project about React on start2impact. 

It is a website designed for vegetarians. In fact inside the site the user will have the opportunity to search exclusively vegetarian recipes through the spoonacular API.


You can try my project <a href="https://vegetarian-website-s2i-annamiolato.netlify.app/recipes">HERE</a> on Netlify.


# How to use

- Clone the repository with 'git clone'
  
- Run the command 'npm i'
  
- Start the project with the command 'npm run dev'


# About the code

In this project I used Tailwind for the graphics, and Redux along with Axios for the so-called api and store data management. 

I tried to create a simple and clean UX/UI for the user.
